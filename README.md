Project for Course Intriduction to Python Programming, together with other course participant Alensandra M. Basic part was simple operation on .csv file, what I show here is only project extension. Our goal was to do "some data analysis" - after discovering ourselves Python Panda we did basic  operations and visualisation - basic mainly on information find on different tutorials as we didn't have antyhing about Pandas on our course . Of course we spend lot of time on data finding, cleaning and adapting.
